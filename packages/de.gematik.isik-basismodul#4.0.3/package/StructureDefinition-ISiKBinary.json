Patient und Encounter) gestellt. \r\n\r\n### Kompatibilität\r\n\r\nHinweise zu Inkompatibilitäten können über die [Portalseite](https://service.gematik.de/servicedesk/customer/portal/16) gemeldet werden.\r\n\r\n### Hinweis\r\n\r\nDas ISIK-Binary-Profil ist *nicht* Bestandteil der Implementierung und des Bestätigungsverfahrens zum ISIK Basismodul.\r\nDas Profil ist Teil des ISIK Basismoduls, da es als übergreifend genutzte Ressource sowohl im [Modul Terminplanung](https://simplifier.net/guide/isik-terminplanung-v4/ImplementationGuide-markdown-Datenobjekte?version=current) als auch im [Modul Dokumentenaustausch](https://simplifier.net/guide/isik-dokumentenaustausch-v4/ImplementationGuide-markdown-Datenobjekte?version=current) implementiert werden muss.","fhirVersion":"4.0.1","kind":"resource","abstract":false,"type":"Binary","baseDefinition":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Binary","derivation":"constraint","snapshot":{"element":[{"id":"Binary","path":"Binary","short":"Pure binary content defined by a format other than FHIR","definition":"A resource that represents the data of a single raw artifact as digital content accessible in its native format.
