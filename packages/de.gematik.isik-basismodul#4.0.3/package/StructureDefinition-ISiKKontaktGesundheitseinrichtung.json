Ein Beispiel hierfür: Ein Patient bleibt im Bett (Versorgungsstellenkontakt), aber ein Fachabteilungswechsel geschieht, da die Diagnose über eine Fachabteilung (Onkologie) läuft, dann aber der Wechsel zur Fachabteilung Chirurgie (neuer Abteilungskontakt) notwendig wird.\n  Für einen solchen Fall gilt auf Ebene der FHIR-Instanzen (z.B. entgegen des tatsächliche Aufenthaltes im gleichen Bett): Im Falle eines Fachabteilungswechsels legt ein System einen neuen Abteilungskontakt an. Bestehende Versorgungsstellenkontakt SOLLEN NICHT in ihrer Relation (.partOf) zum Abteilungskontakt modifiziert werden. Hingegen SOLL das System einen oder mehrere Versorgungsstellenkontakte erzeugen und mit dem neu angelegten Abteilungskontakt in Verbindung setzen.\n\n  Hintergrund: Das Konzept der 'Kontaktebene' stammt aus dem Fallmodell der Medizininformatik-Initiative, \n    das bei Encountern zwischen 'Einrichtungskontakten', 'Fachabteilungskontakten' und 'Versorgungsstellenkontakten' unterscheidet.\n    Im Kontext dieses Moduls werden lediglich Encounter der Ebene 'Fachabteilungskontakt' abgebildet.","min":1,"max":"1","base":{"path":"Encounter.type","min":0,"max":"*"},"type":[{"code":"CodeableConcept"}],"patternCodeableConcept":{"coding":[{"system":"http://fhir.de/CodeSystem/Kontaktebene","code":"abteilungskontakt"}]},"constraint":[{"key":"ele-1","severity":"error","human":"All FHIR elements must have a @value or children","expression":"hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())","xpath":"@value|f:*|h:div","source":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Element"}],"mustSupport":true,"isModifier":false,"isSummary":true,"binding":{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-bindingName","valueString":"EncounterType"}],"strength":"required","description":"Kontaktebene","valueSet":"http://fhir.de/ValueSet/kontaktebene-de"},"mapping":[{"identity":"workflow","map":"Event.code"},{"identity":"w5","map":"FiveWs.class"},{"identity":"v2","map":"PV1-4 / PV1-18"},{"identity":"rim","map":".code"}]},{"id":"Encounter.type:Kontaktebene.id","path":"Encounter.type.id","representation":["xmlAttr"],"short":"Unique id for inter-element referencing","definition":"Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).

This is used when there is no way to reference the other resource directly, either because the entity it represents is not available through a FHIR server, or because there is no way for the author of the resource to convert a known identifier to an actual location. There is no requirement that a Reference.identifier point to something that is actually exposed as a FHIR instance, but it SHALL point to a business concept that would be expected to be exposed as a FHIR instance, and that instance would need to be of a FHIR resource type allowed by the reference.","comment":"When an identifier is provided in place of a reference, any system processing the reference will only be able to resolve the identifier to a reference if it understands the business context in which the identifier is used. Sometimes this is global (e.g. a national identifier) but often it is not. For this reason, none of the useful mechanisms described for working with references (e.g. chaining, includes) are possible, nor should servers be expected to be able resolve the reference. Servers may accept an identifier based reference untouched, resolve it, and/or reject it - see CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.referencePolicy. \n\nWhen both an identifier and a literal reference are provided, the literal reference is preferred. Applications processing the resource are allowed - but not required - to check that the identifier matches the literal reference\n\nApplications converting a logical reference to a literal reference may choose to leave the logical reference present, or remove it.\n\nReference is intended to point to a structure that can potentially be expressed as a FHIR resource, though there is no need for it to exist as an actual FHIR resource instance - except in as much as an application wishes to actual find the target of the reference. The content referred to be the identifier must meet the logical constraints implied by any limitations on what resource types are permitted for the reference.  For example, it would not be legitimate to send the identifier for a drug prescription if the type were Reference(Observation|DiagnosticReport).  One of the use-cases for Reference.identifier is the situation where no FHIR representation exists (where the type is Reference (Any).","min":1,"max":"1","base":{"path":"Reference.identifier","min":0,"max":"1"},"type":[{"code":"Identifier"}],"constraint":[{"key":"ele-1","severity":"error","human":"All FHIR elements must have a @value or children","expression":"hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())","xpath":"@value|f:*|h:div","source":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Element"}],"mustSupport":true,"isModifier":false,"isSummary":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"rim","map":".identifier"}]},{"id":"Encounter.serviceProvider.display","extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-translatable","valueBoolean":true}],"path":"Encounter.serviceProvider.display","short":"Text alternative for the resource","definition":"Plain text narrative that identifies the resource in addition to the resource reference.","comment":"This is generally not the same as the Resource.text of the referenced resource.
